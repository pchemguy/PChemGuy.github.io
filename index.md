I am a physical chemist, an R&D engineer, and a big admirer of STEM. I enjoy working in the lab, and I also use CAD for developing custom instrumentation. While not being a software developer, programming facilitated a variety of my activities. Most of my projects required Python or C for controlling custom research instruments. I have simulated experiments with TCL and shell scripts and managed research and personal data using MS Excel with VBA. On a volunteering basis, I have administered an Apache+MySQL server and prototyped JavaScript extensions for a bibliography manager.

Recently, I have started exploring my idea of a new research metadata/knowledge management project in my spare time. On this path, I have to learn or refresh my knowledge of the necessary programming technologies and figure out how to accomplish various tasks, with Git/GitHub being one of the first such technologies. The repositories I highlight here are mainly of two types. Some are hands-on tutorial projects I came up with for myself. Others describe tricky problems I faced with, for which I have come across similar inquiries (e.g., on Stackoverflow) but no readily available solutions. I mostly use VBA in Excel, Msys2/MinGW, and Anaconda, hence the scope of my GitHub projects.

Below are links to some of my project pages.
