I am a physical chemist, an R&D engineer, and a big admirer of STEM. While I have not developed software projects, programming facilitated a variety of activities I have been involved with. Most of the projects I have worked on required control of custom research instruments or custom control protocols developed on commercial equipment. Some projects also required simulations, and all of them involved management and custom processing of research data. These activities relied on a variety of programming environments, including C, Python, TCL, in-house developed instrument control software, and shell scripts. I have used extensively MS Excel, including VBA, for work-related and personal data management. Occasional volunteering activities also included some web development, RDBMS administration, and developing javascript extension for a bibliography management software.

Recently, I have started exploring my idea of a new research metadata/knowledge management project in my spare time. On this path, I have to learn or refresh my knowledge of certain programming technologies and figure out how to accomplish certain tasks, with Git/GitHub being one of the first such technologies. The repo's I highlight here are mainly of two types. Some are kind of hands-on tutorial projects I came up with for myself. Others describe certain problems I faced with, for which I have come across similar inquiries (e.g. on Stackoverflow) but no readily available detailed recipe. I am a Windows guy and mostly use VBA in Excel and Msys2/MinGW and Anaconda for other activities, hence the scope of my projects.
